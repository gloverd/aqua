<h1>Lecture Notes</h1>
<p>This contains notes from the slides as well, when it is not explicitly called out during the video lectures. The order within the videos themselves may not follow the exact order from the lectures, as certain sections have been combined or re arranged to provide more concise sections of information.</p>

<h2>Module 1 - Introduction</h2>
<h4>Video 1(A) - Introduction and Homeostasis</h4>
<p><strong>Homeostasis</strong> is the balance of systems to maintain</p>
<ul>
<li>Stimulus (control variable, parameter that needs to be maintained within ideal limits)</li>
<li>Receptors (for this sensed variable (ionic conc/temp/pression) that send a signal over an afferent (outgoing) pathway).</li>
<li>Integrating center (takes input signals and outputs)</li>
<li>Effector (does something to the command signal this is the efferent pathway)</li>
<li>Response (will do something to adjust the variable.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Cell Membrane and Structure</h4>
<p>The main parts of the cell:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mitochondria</strong> create ATP in the cell. The <strong>Rough endoplasmic reticulum</strong> synthesises, stores, then releases proteins for use inside or outside the cell. Most important to us is the <strong>plasma membrane</strong>, it divides the inside from the outside of the cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cell membrane is a lipid bylayer that is made up of polar molecules. the lipid tails (hydrophobic) face each other in the interior of the membrane. The polar head groups (hydrophillic) face outside, and there are several different molecules but they have polar heads and lipid tails.</p>
<p>The lipid tails internal to the membrane there are other structures associated with the membrane <strong>Integral proteins</strong> are proteins that exist throughout the membrane (through and through). There are <strong>peripheral proteins</strong> that are on the inside of the cell, and <strong>carbohydrates</strong> that exist on the outside of the cells.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Channels</strong> or proteins are made up of portions of protein that traverse the bilayer. segments that are embedded in the membrane (non-polar portions of the protein, they dissolve well), other portions are in the extracellular or intracellular region where they have polar segments.</p>
<p>The basic channel is made up of proteins of <strong>Four Segments</strong>, this is a subunit, and one of those four segments is slightly different. if 5 segments unit together, with the different section pointing inwards that faces the interior they can be a channel that can be specialized for different ions.</p>
<h4>Video 3(C) - Membrane Transport</h4>
<p>Transport mechanisms, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diffusion</strong> - (Simple diffusion) - moves from higher concentration down to lower concentration, doesn't show specificity, saturation, or competition.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong> - requires a a carrier or transport protein to be embedded in the membrane. Moves from high concentration to low concentration. shows specificity, saturation and competition. <em>If there is a channel then it is facilitated diffusion.</em></li>
<li><strong>Active transport</strong> - moves against the gradient and moves from a segment of low concentration into high concentration. This requires ATP or energy. displays specificity, saturation, competition, and metabolic inhibition.</li>
<li>Diffusion over small distances takes a short amount of time. Over a long distance it takes exponential amounts of time.</li>
<li>Transport of molecules (endocytosis and exocytosis), where vesicles fuse with the cell membrane, and discharge the material, or invaginations form and create vesicles.</li>
<li>Channels are Open or Closed, in their simplest forms. They can be somewhat selective, as for a class of substances (double charged cations) or super selective (sodium channels).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 4(D) - Osmosis and osmotic pressure</h4>
<p>A cell of a certain concentration (conc) of non penetrating solutes, in the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isotonic solution</strong> - same conc of non penetrating solutes, the cell stays the same volume</li>
<li><strong>Hypertonic solution</strong> - larger conc of non penetrating solutes, the cell shrinks.</li>
<li><strong>Hypotonic solution</strong> - smaller conc of non penetrating solutes, the cell swells. you will reach a point where the cell will burst (lysis).</li>
<li>Excessive shrinking or swelling, will stress the membrane and disturb the function of the membrane proteins. An isotonic solution is required to maintain homeostasis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Osmotic pressure can be derived from:</p>
<pre><code>osmotic pressure(mmHg) = R*T*\phi*i*c
R=62.36 L*mmHg*degK^-1*mol^-1
T=absolute Temp, K
/phi = osmotic coefficient
i=number of particles (no account of size/charge)
c=molar concentration, mol*L^-1 (molar, moles/liter)
</code></pre>
<p>and Osmolality is:</p>
<pre><code>Osmolality = \phi*n*c
/phi = osmotic coefficient
n=number of particles
c=molal concentration (mol solute/kg solvent)
</code></pre>
<p>154nM NaCl is isotonic to human red blood cells.</p>
<h4>Video 5(E) - Cellular Receptors / Binding sites</h4>
<p>Ligands bind to receptors on the cells; the shapes fit and the charge distribution matches creating tight binding (high affinity). How is this done?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are portions of the protein that make up a structure, and due to their folding they make up polar(charged) and non polar (non charged) three dimensional shapes that when put together with ligands match.
Multiple ligands are able to bind to receptors, but sometimes they can be very specific. the more general the shape and charge distribution the more likely it is to be able to bind to multiple receptors/ligands.</li>
<li>high affinity binding, fits charge and shape. intermediate affinity, is a weak shape or week charge binding. low affinity, is ill fitting shape or no charge.</li>
<li><strong>Allosteric modulation</strong> is when there is a regulatory site remote from the functional binding site, where if a regulatory molecule binds to it, it will modify the functional site, and then the ligand can bind.</li>
<li><strong>Covalent modulation</strong> is when phosphorylation can happen on a remote site (say -OH) the energy from hydrolysis of ATP changes the functional site. dephosphorylation will revert the change. This happens with smooth muscle.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 6(F) - Membrane Potential</h4>
<p>Measuring the membrane potential of the cell (inside with respect to outside) there is a voltage difference. For resting is around 0-70mV. How does this arise? Through the conc of different species of substances found inside/outside the cells, they are charged and create a resting cell membrane potential. Energy (ATP) is required to maintain cell membrane resting potential.</p>
<p>Assumtions for Nernst Equation</p>
<ul>
<li>[X]i =/= [X]o</li>
<li>permeant ions move down its conc gradient</li>
<li>movement of ions sets up an electrical gradient across the membrane</li>
<li>Eq is achieved when chemical and electrical forces are of equal magnitude and opposite direction.</li>
<li>membrane has a constant thickness, is homogenious, and infinite in its transverse plane</li>
<li>the solutions: are well mixed (uniform), and concentrations of ionic species do not chagne.</li>
<li>ionic motility: is constant and coeffficients don't change. osmotic pressure gradient and hydrostatic pressure gradient are negligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemical potential is</p>
<ol>
<li>myu = myu_0 + R/*T/*ln[s]</li>
<li>F=-\delta*U</li>
<li>F_chem = -\delta\myu = -\delta(myu_0+R/*T/*ln[s])</li>
<li>F_chem =-d/dx(myu_0+R/*T/*ln[s])=-R/*T/*d/dx(ln[s])</li>
<li>F_chem_net = F_chem_1-&gt;2 - F_chem_2-&gt;1</li>
<li>F_chem_net = -RT/*d/dx(ln[s]1) + RT/*d/dx(ln[s]2)</li>
<li>F_chem_net = R/*T/*d/dx(ln[s2]/[s1])</li>
<li>F_elec = -Q*dV/dx</li>
<li>F_elec = -zF*dV/dx</li>
<li>F_elec_net = -zF(dV1/dz - dV2/dx)</li>
<li>F-elec_net = -zf*d/dx(V1-V2)</li>
<li>Net has to be equal to zero.</li>
<li>RT/zF * ln ([s1]/[s2]) = V1-V2</li>
<li>V_membrane = V1&gt;2 = (RT/zF)*ln([S]out/[S]in)</li>
<li>V_membrane = +/- 61.56*log10([s]out/[s]in)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Video 7(G) - Membrane potential, continued</h4>
<p>The nernst potential, is the balance between the electrical and the chemical potentials. The chemical forces will be in balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>If V_membrane = V_nernst
<ul>
<li>membrane is in balance, no net ion flux</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>V_membrane is same sign as V_nernst but larger magnitude
<ul>
<li>ion will move in direction of electrical force (electrical force is larger than chemical).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>v_membrane same sign as V_nernst but smaller magnitude
<ul>
<li>chemical force is larger than electrical, ions will move in direction of chemical force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>v_membrane is of opposite sign to the v_nernst
<ul>
<li>the chemical and electrical are acting in the same directions, it will move driven by two forces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more than one ion in the extracellular fluid.</p>
<p>GHK equation is for Na K and CL: you can put a P_Na or general P as a coefficient for each of the concentrations</p>
<pre><code>    RT     (Na_o   K_o   Cl_i)
V_m -- * ln(---- + --- + ----)  
    F      (Na_i   K_o   Cl_i)
</code></pre>
<p>To study conductivity (if potential, and nernst are different then) current of the ion will be:</p>
<pre><code>I = g(E_m - E_n)
I_k + I_Na + I_Cl = 0
</code></pre>
<p>so the resting membrane potential is given by the core conductance equation: (equilibrium will be determined by the contributions of each conductivity)</p>
<pre><code>        g_k       g_Na       g_Cl
E_m =   ----E_k + ----E_Na + ----E_cl
        sum(g)    sum(g)     sum(g)
</code></pre>
<p>If there is only one then the nernst is the membrane potential. If there are potassium and sodium (or more) it is weighed by the conductivity of each. Potassium has a high conductivity than Sodium at resting (g_k &gt; g_Na).</p>
<p>Baseline equilibrium is kept by the Na/K-ATPase pump, with 3Na moving across gradient and pulling 2K in, using an ATP. This keeps a negative membrane on the inside.</p>
<p>A leak channel allows Na in while K comes out. This is sufficient to keep a baseline.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Module 2 - Excitable Membranes, Synapses</h2>
<h4>Video 1(A) - Generation of Action Potentials</h4>
<p>An *<em>Action Potential</em> is a rapid reversal in membrane potential, from a resting membrane potential (RMP) to a spike and back. The parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resting membrane potential (RMP)</li>
<li>Depolarization</li>
<li>overshoot</li>
<li>repolarization</li>
<li>afterhyperpolarizaition</li>
</ul>
<p>Membrane Channels have voltage gated channels, for Sodium there are two gates. As the cells depolarize more, more Sodium rushes in because more gates are opened. Once enough cells are opened it is inactivated, and the uptake stops.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>State</th><th>Activation Gate</th><th>Inactivation Gate</th><th>Membrane potential</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Resting</td><td>Closed</td><td>Open</td><td>-90 mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>Activated</td><td>Open</td><td>Open</td><td>-90 mV to +35 mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inactivated</td><td>Open</td><td>Closed</td><td>+35 mV to -90 mV; delayed</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For Potassium there is only one gate:</p>
<table>

<tr><th>State</th><th>Gate</th><th>Membrane potential</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>Resting</td><td>Closed</td><td>-90 mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slow Activation</td><td>Open</td><td>+35 mV to -90 mV</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As the membrane potential begins to go less negative, and potassium can leave the cell, re-polarizing the schedule.</p>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Ion Channels</h4>
<p>The structure of a voltage dependent sodium channel is made out of four repeating 6-unit motifs. The channel is not just a cylinder, but the position of the amino acids in the channel and their composition will determine its functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>The S4 of each unit is the voltage sensor which detects membrane potential, determining the opening/closing of the channel.</li>
<li>The intracellular loop connecting domains 3-4 is the inactivation gate. (Think ball-and-chain method).</li>
<li>Helix that connects 5-6 in each of the domains, it dips back into the membrane as a &quot;pore loop&quot;. that helps form the selectivity filter of the channel. The residues in the loop determine the ionic selectivity of the channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>A potassium channel, and other channels, work as transistors. over a range of voltages, it has an ON or OFF status, but the switch from one to the other happens over a very short period (more sensitive). Channels are Quantal in nature (OPEN or CLOSED).</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Membrane Potential</strong> can be done with <em>Cell-attached mode</em> which is where a pipette is used to <strong>patch clamp</strong> to hopefully only one channel. An <em>Inside out patch</em>, where the membrane is ripped along with the pore is ripped out of the membrane, so you can control solutions on each side (pipette and solution imersed in). Finally <em>Whole cell mode</em> you suck it open to control the whole inside of the cell, compared to the outside, and control the solution itself.</p>
<p>Different kinds of nervous systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somatic Nervous System (SNS) - under voluntary Control
<ul>
<li>(pathway) goes through CNS (brain and spinal cord)</li>
<li>(controls) skeletal muscle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) - involuntary
<ul>
<li>(controls) smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and glands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enteric Nervous System (ENS) - involuntary
<ul>
<li>(innervation) sensory receptors and neurons in GI tract and enteric plexuses</li>
<li>(pathway) can skip CNS (brain and spinal cord)</li>
<li>(control) smooth muscle, glands, and enydocrine cells of GI tract</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electrotonic conduction</strong> - if a depolarization occurs over a region of a cell membrane there is a spread of depolarization. There is current between the deploarized and resting (because of a change in voltage). Every patch of cell has to be depolarized in a wave. As the flow moves along the axon, size of the depolarization decreases. The action potential will eventually die out over time, the depolarization will decay at 1/e.</p>
<p>for a length diameter (lambda) a large neuron has low resistance there is a certain kind of fall off; on a smaller diameter there is a higher resistance, and the space constant is smaller, so the effect of the sub action potential falls off faster.</p>
<p><strong>schwann cells</strong> wrap around a nerve cell to provide insulation for the nerve. These form myelin sheaths, which wrap around a large insulation. They are separated by sections of uninsulated nerve, called Nodes of Ranvier. The current of electrotonic conduction will not happen on each adjacent patch, since it is wrapped by the insulator on the internode-regions. it jumps from node to node forming <strong>saltatory conduction</strong>. Fast local currents happen inside the myelin sheaths (internodes), and the action potentials <em>jump</em> from node to node. The velocity is distance/time, and it is a high conduction velocity in the internode region.</p>
<h4>Video 3(C) - Propagation of Action Potentials</h4>
<p>(See video 2(B) notes, its the exact same).</p>
<h4>Video 4(D) - Chemical Synapses</h4>
<p>Nerve anatomy, three salient features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell body</strong> - also called the Soma</li>
<li><strong>dendrites</strong> - carry incomming signals into the cell body. extend volumetrically all around the cell body.</li>
<li><strong>axon</strong> - one outgoing process, carries efferent signal. these make contact all along the nerve.</li>
<li><strong>pre-synaptic terminals</strong>, ends of axises. these overlay forming synapses.</li>
<li><strong>synapse</strong> - where pre-synaptic terminals overlay the neuron.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-synaptic terminals lie close to but not touching the post-synaptic membrane, forming the synapse with the space between being called the synaptic cleft. the post-synaptic terminal has receptor proteins on the surface.</p>
<p>An action potential that is fired on the axon of a pre-synaptic cell processes down the axon down to the terminal bouton (pre-synaptic terminal). this openes voltage gated Ca2+ channels. This allows vesicles carrying neurotransmitters, to fuse with the membrane and diffuse them across the synaptic cleft and bind to post-synaptic receptors. These neurotransmitters are then removed from the synaptic cleft either drifts away, is re-uptaken, or recycled (or broken down by enzymes).</p>
<p>When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor, and the receptor affects/open a channel it can have the following responses that are rather local to the region of the synapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>** Effectatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)** - say some sodium was allowed to enter the channel. it did not reach threshold to trigger an action potential, but it depolarized the membrane, this can die out over time/distance as mentioned above.</li>
<li>** Inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP)** - If it is a potassium channel, where the exit of potassium will cause a hyperpolarization (polarization of the channel).</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be added together in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporal Summation</strong> -- One signal is triggered twice very fast.
<ul>
<li>Think: ----A-----A-A-A-------</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Summation</strong> - Multiple signals at the same time, that add together.
<ul>
<li>Think: --A-----B-----AB--------AB</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of both can happen, to have signals sent at the same time/fast. An inhibitory synapse can also negate these effects using the same summation, meaning it is not only positive additions. There are thousands and thousands of these synapses on each post-synaptic cell. Distance from the Soma is a a factor during summation.</p>
<p>If excitatory inputs are sent from far away of the cell body, they can be cancelled easily by inhibitory signals close to the cell body. The summation actually happens at an area called the <strong>Axon hillock</strong> it is the initial segment of the axon closest to the cell body. It is very rich in sodium channels, so if an action potential is fired, it is fired there. and then travels down the Axon.</p>

<h2>Module 3 - Skeletal Muscle</h2>
<h4>Video 1(A) - Introduction to Muscle</h4>
<ul>
<li>Specialized to generate force and/or shortening.</li>
<li>Useful for maintaining homeostasis (See Module 1). The maintenance of a body's internal environment that is ideal to continue living. Muscle contributes to homeostasis by allowing you to interact w/ external environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Skeletal muscle</strong> - allows you to move. Under voluntary control (mostly, think of reflexes).</li>
<li><strong>Smooth muscle</strong> - useful for digestion, blood distribution. Surrounds hollow organs (gut, vasculature), and contraction/relaxation moves things or doesn't move things along. It is involuntary, intrinsic to tissue, neural (hard wiring), or hormonal (chemicals/ligands circulating in blood that bind to receptors in tissue and activate it). Smooth is same from anatomy</li>
<li><strong>Cardiac muscle</strong> - pumping blood in the heart. It is under involuntary control, intrinsic to muscle, neural (nerves to parts of the heart), and hormonal control (circulating ligands that bind to the tissue and cause changes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Structure</h4>
<ul>
<li>A muscle is composed of bundles of <strong>muscle fasciculus</strong> (made up of individual fasciculi) which is made up of what appear to be cylinders. These are Muscle Fibers. Each <strong>Muscle Fiber</strong> cell contains multiple <em>myofibrils</em>, which have banding patterns on them. This gives it the name <em>Striated Muscle</em>.</li>
<li>Bands are called <strong>sarcomeres</strong> (delineated by Z-disks) which is a functional unit of skeletal muscle. There are various regions within this band. The sarcomeres are composed of proteins, Actin and myosin, as well as titin which is used to hold things in place, but does not play a direct role in contractility. The thin filaments are arranged in a cross section so that there is a regular hexagonal array. Thick filaments have 6 nearest neighbors, thin filaments have 3.
<ul>
<li>A sarcomere is delineated by <strong>Z-disks</strong> on the sides. Between the two disks are various bands. These are characteristic of what filaments are where and what is overlapping.</li>
<li>The <strong>H-band</strong> is at the center of the sarcomere (called the <strong>M-line</strong>) and is composed of only myosin. It is dark because myosin is thick but not the darkest. The <strong>A-band</strong> is also centered within the sarcomere, and has the H-band overlapping its center. This band is the full width of the myosin filaments. On each of the ends of the A-band's (that is the section that is not overlapping with the H-band), is where myosin and actin overlap.</li>
<li>The <strong>I-band</strong> is centered over the z-disk itself, so each extreme of a sarcomere has a portion of an I-band. These are composed only of the thin filament.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Actin (thin filament)</strong> - From the z-disks projecting to the center of the sarcomere.
<ul>
<li>Actin is a globular protein (can be monomeric) which aggregates together to form a filament. Two of these filaments wound around each other form an <strong>actin thin filament</strong>. The protein <strong>nebulin</strong> (structural protein) aligns the thin filament and keeps it in register - no other function or impact in contractility.</li>
<li>Two other proteins <strong>Tropomyosin</strong> (rod like) and <strong>troponin</strong> (more globular).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Myosin (thick filament)</strong> - From the center of the sarcomere projecting outwards, held in place by titin. Light myosin and Heavy myosin exist within it.
<ul>
<li>Have a swelling at one end  (The S1 region, composed of light chains) but otherwise rod like (heavy chains, insoluble tail portion). They aggregate tail to tail at the central region of the sarcomere. The cross projections (also called cross-bridges) are spaced at regular longitudinal and circumferential intervals.</li>
<li>The cross bridges have an <strong>S2-segment</strong> which acts as a coiled spring, and an <strong>S1-segment</strong> which has two heads, but functionally can be thought of as one. The S1 globular heads are important for the function of myosin ATPase activity. A hinge region exists between S1-S2 and at the connection to the tail-S1. These give the filament a large range of motion in which to move.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Troponin</strong> has three distinct sub-units -- TnC, TnI, TnT.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Video 3(C) - Some Observations on Force</h5>
<ul>
<li>During contraction, the A-band length doesn't change. Invariant to sarcomere length. The I-band gets smaller as I-disks get pushed together. The H-zone will get smaller, and in some cases can vanish. Suggests a sliding mechanism, where filaments themselves do not change length.</li>
<li><strong>Force Generation</strong> over sarcomere length has a plateau where force is optimal, while sarcomere length changes.
<ul>
<li>At 3.65 micron length of the sarcomere there is no tension generated. no filament overlap.</li>
<li>At 2.62 there is maximal overlap. Force increases from 3.65 until 2.62 in a linear manner.</li>
<li>Until 2.0 there the force plateau, where maximal strength is contained.</li>
<li>Until 1.62 there is a decrease where the thin filaments overlap and there are less cross bridges connected between actin and myosin.</li>
<li>Until 1.27 there is a very sharp decrease which is attributed to the overlap of one extreme of myosin reaching the opposing myosin filament, which then 'pushes it' instead of pulls since the overlap is so far. and it works to accelerate the decrease in force generation. Finally the interactions have no other movement to do.</li>
</ul>

<li>ATP has two functions: Hydrolized ATP gives energy for the movement. ATP decreases selectivity to actin and allows for the Myosin to detach from actin.</li>

<h4>Video 4(D) - Regulation of Contraction and Relaxation</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the impact of ^[Ca2+]? Under .1microM, there is little force of generation, around 1 microM there is a significant saturation, around 100microM it is saturated.</li>
<li><strong>Steric Hinderance Model</strong> -- Tropomyosin gets in the way of the binding sites on Actin, preventing Myosin from binding to Actin. With a high cytosolic [Ca2+] the Ca binds to TnC and the tropomyosin moves into the grove of the actin, exposing binding sites. Binding will be permitted as long as there is ATP for cycling, and [Ca2+] to keep binding sites exposed.</li>
<li>Binding of TnC+Ca, causes change in TnI which causes the move.</li>
</ul>
<p>[read paper by Ruegg?]</p>
<ul>
<li>How does [Ca2+] Increase? The muscle cell surface membrane (<strong>sarcolemma</strong>) has structures relating to myofibrils. The <strong>Sarcoplasmic reticulum</strong> or <strong>SR</strong>. At the end of each segment there is a <strong>lateral sac</strong> or <strong>terminal cisternae</strong>. There are tubular structures called <strong>t-tubules</strong> that are open through the sarcolemma which allow the extracellular fluid to reach inside the muscle. A t-tubule is sandwitched by two lateral sacs, this is called a <em>Triad</em>.</li>
<li>The t-tubular system and the SR wrap tightly around the myofibrils. When an action potential is fired on the muscle cell membrane. *The action potential propagates down the t-tubule since it is an extension of the sarcolemma/surface membrane.</li>

<h4>Video 5(E) - Regulation of Contraction and Relaxation (continued)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The T-tubules and the SR are not physically connected, but liked explained above, they are coupled together through a <strong>Triad Juction</strong>. This coupling occurs through a voltage sensor in the membrane of the t-tuble the <strong>DHRP</strong> (or DHP/Dihydropyridine receptor). On the SR there is a <strong>RyR</strong> (Ryanodine Receptor) in the lateral sac of the terminal cisternae which opens a Ca2+ channel in the membrane of the lateral sac allowing the release of calcium into the myofilament space.</li>
<li>The coupling mechanism uses the 6-element 4-repeat motif for the receptor of DHRP, which senses the voltage change. Here a loop couples with the RyR, which opens a Ca Channel in the lateral sac of the SR.</li>
<li>For <em>Timing of these changes</em>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Potential</strong> is in the timeframe of miliseconds (1-3ms).</li>
<li><strong>Myoplasmic [Ca2+]</strong> is released in a bolus and spikes very quickly (~20ms mark) and decreases until about 100ms.</li>
<li><strong>Ca2+-troponin</strong> - Peaks just after myoplasmic [Ca2+] (30ms), and stays at a peak until about 60ms, since it is saturated. It decreaes sharply after cross-brdige cycling has gone through a few cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Twitch Force</strong> starts as soon as the myoplasmic [Ca2+] increases, duration about 200ms, peaks around 60ms, as soon as Ca-troponin starts to decrease. Force persists as long as cross-bridges are attached.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Motor End Plate</strong> has lots of Sodium channels and the AcH-esterases.</li>
<li>The whole process looks as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Action potential is initiated and propagates to motor neuron axon terminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calcium enters axon terminals through voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calcium entry triggers release of ACh from axon terminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ACh diffuses from axon terminals to motor end plate in muscle fiber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on motor end plate, increasing their permeability to Na+ and K+.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More Na+ moves into the fiber at the motor end plate that K+ moves out, depolarizing the membrane and producing the end plate potential (EPP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local currents depolarize the adjacent muscle cell plasma membrane to its threshold potential, generation an action potential that propagates over the muscle fiber surface and into the fiber along the t-tubules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action potential in T-tubules induces DHP receptors to pull open RyR channels allowing release of Ca2+ from lateral sacs of sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ca2+ binds to troponin on the thin filaments, causing tropomyosin to move away from its blocking position thereby uncovering cross bridge binding sites on actin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energized myosin cross-bridges on the thick filaments bind to actin:</p>
<p>A + M*ADP*Pi -&gt; A*M*ADP*Pi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-bridge binding triggers release of ATP hydrolysis products from myosin, producing an angular movement of each cross-bridge:</p>
<p>A*M*ADP*Pi -&gt; A*M + ADP + Pi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ATP binds to myosin, breaking linkage between actin and myosin and thereby allowing cross-bridges to dissociate from actin:</p>
<p>A*M + ATP -&gt; A + M*ATP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ATP bound to myosin is split, energizing the myosin cross-bridge:</p>
<p>A + M*ATP -&gt; A + M*ADP*Pi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-bridges repeat steps 10-13, producing movement (sliding) of the thin filaments past thick filaments. Cycles of cross-bridge movement continue as long as Ca2+ remains bound to troponin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration decreases as Ca2+-APTase actively transports Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of Ca2+ from troponin restores blocking action of tropomyosin, the cross-bridge cycle ceases, and the muscle fiber relaxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Module 7(G) - Mechanics</h4>
<ul>
<li>If a muscle length is held constant a contraction is called <strong>Isometric contraction</strong>. After a stimulus, the muscle develops force, reaches a peak and then falls.</li>
<li>If the muscle is allowed to contract and move a load with its shortening, then it is called an <strong>Isotonic Contraction</strong>. With this contraction there is a latent period while it gathers sufficient force to lift the weight. there is a peak amount of shortening, the muscle develops force, and then a rapid lenghening process untill the load is dropped back onto its support.</li>
<li><strong>Force vs Time</strong> - and isometric twitch there is no length change. For isotonic twitches, the muscles will increase tension (climb isometric envelope) until it is able to lift the load, then it will shorten.</li>
<li>The <strong>initial velocity of shortening (V_0)</strong> is higher for light loads than for heavy loads. As load increases V_0 it goes through a hyperbola shape until the load is the same as the force and there is no isotonic shortening (zero velocity).</li>
<li>When V_0 is maximal, load on the muscle is 0, is a reflection of the cycling rate of the cross bridges which in turn is a reflection of the ATPase rate in the muscle.</li>
<li>A ** Lengthening contraction** is  when the lengthening velocity is negative.</li>
<li>A muscle fiber AP (3ms) is rapid compared to contraction (200ms). if there is a faster rate of stimuli there can be a faster response to stimuli and an <strong>unfused tetanus</strong> can occur, a relatively constant force with some oscilations. If the stimulation rate is fast enough you can get a <strong>fused tetanus</strong> which is on the order of 3X the force of a single twitch. This is because intracellular free [Ca2+] increaes each time, and oscilates with the stimulation and reaches a fairly constant value.</li>
<li>Another way to increase force, is to increase the number of muscle cells firing together. More motor units can fire together at the same time. Very fine control muscles (orbital muscles of the eye), have small number of muscles per motor units, so control is at a small quanta. Postural muscles have a small number of muscle units, but many fibers per motor unit.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronos motor-unit activity</strong> can maintain a near constant tension in the total muscle. Staggering the twitch contractions of individual motor units can be effective instead of firing one unit many times.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Module 8(H) - Biochemistry</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Role of ATP in muscles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle contraction and relaxation requires energy for maintainance of resting membrane potential (Na+/K+ pump in the sarcolemma of every cell), and without that pump it won't be electrically excitable.</li>
<li>Energy is required to form energized Myosin (M*ATP -&gt; M*ADP*Pi)</li>
<li>Update of Ca2+ into the SR, to reduce intracellular [Ca2+] to relax the muscle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have a single muscle fiber doing single twitches at a relatively slow rate it can go on for a while. If the rate increases the muscle will fatigue, even though the APs continue to trigger, but we have run out of ATP. If a muscle is tenanized it will fatigue, after a small rest it will be able to tenatize but for not as long then fatigue again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create ATP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creatine Phosphase</strong> and ADP - will give creatine and ATP. This is a buffer system, and will do it short term. There is not a lot that can be created.</li>
<li><strong>Oxidative Phosphrylation</strong> - depends on a supply of oxygen and feed stocks (glucose, fatty acids) from the blood. or could come in from amino acids, but that breaks down the body. For each glucose, it creates 36 units of ATP.</li>
<li><strong>Aerobic Glycolysis</strong> - requires some blood supply for Glucose, but does not require oxygen. Inefficient, 2 ATP for every glucose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different muscles contract at various rates, some are faster some are slower, the speed of unloaded shortening is correlated with myosin ATP-ase activity, and related to crossbridge cycling rate. The faster the cross-bridges, the more ATP it needs, the faster the muscle moves. We can classify muscle by <strong>twtch speed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow twitch - reistant to fatigue</strong> - will last long during a tetanus</li>
<li><strong>Fast twitch - resistant to fatigue</strong> - will be quick and give small tetanus</li>
<li><strong>Fast twitch - fatigable</strong> - no real tetanus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Module 4 - Smooth Muscle</h2>
<h4>Video 1(A) - Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview Similarities</strong> - Both <strong>smooth muscle cells (SMC)</strong> and skeletal muscle use same contractile mechanism (the interaction of Actin and Myosin). Both use intracellular [Ca2+] to contract/relax. The peak force in smooth muscle and skeletal muscle are about the same, even though sises are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Overview Differences</strong> - Smooth muscles are smaller and shaped differently. Smooth muscles are autonomic, instead of somatic, and are not voluntary. The site of regulation of <em>contraction is at the thick filaments</em>, not thin (skeletal). The time course for smooth muscle is slower than skeletal muscle. There are no t-tubules in smooth muscle, and the SMC have a higher degree of shortening (proportionally) than skeletal muscle, so the <strong>Force Length Curve is broader</strong> in SMC than Skeletal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Anatomy</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Skeletal muscle cells (Myofibrils)</em> - long and cylindrical, with a ratio of length:diameter is large. 100microns diameter, several mm long.</li>
<li><em>Smooth muscle cells (SMC)</em> - more amorphous with tapering at either end (Spindle shaped), less ratio of length:diameter. 2-10 microns in diameter, 40-600micros long.</li>
<li>SMCs have <strong>Dense Bodies</strong> which serve as anchor points for intermediate filaments and thin filaments. There are <strong>Gap Junctions</strong> have electrical <em>and chemical</em> communication between cells. There are thin fillaments and thick filaments that form sarcomeres. But these are at different angles along the cell so there is not a uniform pattern.</li>
<li>2x Actin and .25x Myosin compared to skeletal muscle. When they contract since they are not held at the ends, they kind of ball up, and form a 'netting' over the muscle.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 3(C) - Crossbridge Cycling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Force-velocity curves</strong> - shortening velocity vs load forms a hyperbola, where smooth muscle is way in the weeds compared to skeletal muscle. However focusing on SMC only -- you will notice that it varies with phosphorylation status , and velocity of unloaded shortening is higher with higher phosphorylation. There is a linear relationship. If you plot force, its linear at lower levels and tails off at higher levels. Remember -- The head of myosin has light chains on it that is the S2 arm region.</li>

<p>This is the same as skeletal, except the light chains are able to be phosphorylated.</p>
<ul>
<li>In SMC there is MLCK (Myosin Light Chain Kinase), that given high myofilament [Ca2+] you can phosphorylate. Four molecules of Ca will bind to Calmodulin (CM). and this (CaCM) will bind to  MLCK. A kinase is something that phosphorolates a protein, in this case, the myosin light chain.

<li>decrease Ca2+ : CaCM-MLCK -&gt; MLCK_off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If intracellular free [Ca2+] drops, there isn't calcium to bind to Calmodulin and the phosphorylation by MLCK happens slower, and the <strong>myosin phosphatase (MP)</strong> has been doing the opposite. phosphotase is something that dephosphorylates. that has been dephosphorylating the crossbridges.</li>
<li>A dephosphorylated light chain cannot bind to actin.
<ul>
<li>increase Ca2+ : rate of CaCm-MLCK phosphorylates faster</li>
<li>decrease of Ca2+ : rate of myosin phosphatase dephosphorylates faster that CaCM-MLCK can phosphorylate.</li>

<p>More observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you stimulate smooth muscle, there is a bolus release of Ca2+ then &quot;velocy and cross-bridge phosphorylation&quot; then the force appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you keep a stimulus active (tonic contraction) there will be a bolus release of Ca2++ but then instead of returning to baseline it will stay elevated. &quot;velocity of cross-bridge phosphorylation&quot; peaks then stays again elevated, about 50%, while force is generated and stays high. This is similar to a tonic contraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two cycles</strong> -- Covalent regulation allows for eight cross-bridge states in smooth muscle. Phosphorylation by MLCK is obligatory for cross bridge attachment. Phosphorylated cross bridges cycle relatively rapidly. dephosphorylation of a cross-bridge during a cycle by a constantly active MP slows cycling rate. and produces the latch state. Calcium regulates cross-bridge cycling by determining phosphorylation rates. <em>Note that ATP is required for both regulation, and cycling</em>.</p>

<h2>Module 5 - Cardiac Muscle</h2>
<h4>Video 1(A) - Anatomy</h4>
<p>Keeping in mind what we know of skeletal and smooth muscle. The <strong>left ventricle</strong> pumps blood out of the heart for systemic circulation. <strong>Right ventricle</strong> pumps to the lungs for loading of oxygen. In the wall of the hear there is <strong>myocardial tissue</strong> which is striated like skeletal muscle. The ends of the filaments are connected by <strong>Intercalated disks</strong> for individual muscle cells. There are <strong>gap junctions</strong> and a structure called a <strong>desmosome</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the region of a <strong>desmosome</strong>, the separation of the two cells separates a little and there are structural proteins (plaque) link the cells together physically, so that when stretch of physical movement happens in one, the other knows.  attaches with intermediate filaments at ends and sides. structural proteins in the extracellular space between the two membranes, connect to an anchor (a plaque) on the inner segment of the cells, then the intermediate filaments connect to the rest of the cells).</li>
<li>The <strong>Gap junction</strong> has the cells closer together, than the rest of the intercalated disk so that ions can freely cross from one cell to the other. AP's from one cell can be communicated from one to the other. Channels are made up of connexin protein (for unit protein, to extracellular loops, and one intercellular loop) and so connexins can form to create a connexon &quot;channel&quot; and anything small enough to fit through can. The connexins can be modified for specificity if needed. In general can be open or closed.</li>
<li><strong>Adherens Junction (Fascia Adherents)</strong> is similar to the desmosome, it has physical junctions to join cells. these link to the cytoskeleton of the cell, at the ends. It uses cadherins to connect <em>catenins</em> at the end. they are different than desmosomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In cardiac there is not a <em>Triad</em> instead there is a <strong>Diad</strong>, because the T-tubues come down at the z-bands, since we look at one lateral cisternae of the SR. The SR in cardiac in cardiac is not as rich as skeletal muscle.</p>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Physiology</h4>
<p>If you take a piece of skeletal muscle and hold it between two supports and stretch the supports, and measure the force, there is a force that increases as you strech. If you try and stimulate it, you will see that at high stretch (and high compression) it decreases force. The max active force generates more tension.</p>
<p>For Cardiac muscle the total tensions starts separating early and increases rapidly. this helps when the hearts chambers fill and become full. the heart will resist further filling, which is an advantage for cardiac muscle as opposed to skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>There is a NCX (sodium calcium exchanger) is reversible, based on potential, and on location).</p>
<p>An action potential in the heart is prolonged (200ms), and the rise in calcium is also long, taking a long time to fully decrease. The force (contraction) time course is also long and it lags. How is calcium handled in the cell?</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcium channels, with only a little entering through the channels, triggering a bolus release of calcium from the SR. <strong>calcium induced calcium release</strong>. there is an ATP powered pump that returns calcium into SR.. the NCX is secondary active tranport for Ca extrusion into sarcolemma. some calcium is taken into mitochondria, which plays almost no role.
<ul>
<li>SR updates about 70%</li>
<li>NCX takes out around 28%</li>
<li>The SL Ca-ATPase and mitochondria is very small and slow, about 2%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contractile force vs Time</strong> - dyes can be used light up in presence of free Ca2+, and quantate the light to quantify conc.</p>
<p>If <strong>Isoproteranol</strong> (a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist // beta agonist) is added, it increases
- the amplitude of the extracellular Ca2+ transient and hence the amount of force generated.
- faster decay
- faster peak of force, and faster rise, and faster decay
Beta stimulation, increases size, rate and decay of force.</p>
<p>A cell under <strong>Sympathetic stimulation <em>(releases beta agonists</em></strong>. If a beta protein binds to its receptor (<strong>Epinephrine/norepinephrine</strong>), it triggers a stimulatory G-protein, which leads to the activation of AC (Adenyl? cyclase) in the sarcolemma which leads to a rise of cAMP in cytosol, which activates <strong>Protein Kinase A (PKA)</strong>, which phosphorylates other things, such as :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>L-type calcium channel</em>*, which increases amount of calciuym that enters the cell</li>
<li><strong>RyR channel</strong>, which results increase in the size of the bolus release from SR, more Ca is avail to troponin, likely more cross bridges can cylce, force incresaes.</li>
<li><strong>Phospholamban</strong>, which increases the rate of the ATP powered pump that pulls calcium back into the SR for storage. more Ca is stored in the SR, and it is pulled out of the myofilament space more quickly, increasing rate of fall of intracellular Ca.</li>
<li><strong>TnI</strong>, which results in TnC being less sensitive for Ca binding. so Ca comes of TnC faster, so more free calcium in myofilament space, entering SR faster.
<ul>
<li>In effect -- force will drop, calcium doesn't dwell as long on TroponinC, cross bridges can't cycle as long in time, so force won't be as high.</li>
<li>But the increase in bolus release of Ca outweighs this, so <strong>the net effect</strong> is increased force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ACh binds to <strong>muscorinic receptor (M2-Rec)</strong> which turns on an inhibitory G-protein, which reduces amount of intracellular cAMP, which reduces the activation of <strong>PKA</strong>, so all the above paths are less likely.</p>
<p>Both systems go to the heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (Epinephrine/norepinephrine)</li>
<li>Parasympathetic branch (ACh)
with them rate of heart and control of the heart can be controlled.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you <strong>stretch cardiac muscle</strong>, the active contractile muscle will increase, peak, then fall. <em>Frank-Sterling law of the heart</em>. Force vs intracellular free calcium -- for a given [Ca2+] if we stretch it, we get more force.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sarcomeres go to a more ideal length.</li>
<li>Myofilaments are more sensative to Ca2+</li>
</ol>
<p>A possible expaination for #2, is that titin not only binds to myosin, but it also binds to actin in cardiac muscle. if you strech the sarcomere, you might be pulling the thin filaments closer to the thick filaments, so increasing the likelyhood of the actin binding to myosin.</p>

<h4>Video 1(A) - Cardiac Action Potentials : <em>Types and what they look like</em> (10:28)</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Slow (pacemaker) action potential</strong> -- found in specialized regions in the heart (e.g. the <em>sino atrial node</em> and the <em>atrial ventricular node</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Has phases 0 (rise),3 (fall), 4 (afterhyperpolarization).</li>
<li>resting membrane potential ~-60 mV, peak at positive, quick return to 'resting' which is a slow re-polarization.</li>
<li>duration ~200ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast action potential</strong> - found in cardiac muscle.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 (rapid upstroke), 1 (rapid early repolarization), 2 (droopy plateau region), 3 (recovery (repolarization) region), 4 (return to resting, at resting)</li>
<li>resting membrate potential ~-80 mV</li>
<li>duration ~200ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cardiac fast action potential details - The duration of the action potential extends well into the contraction event (force/contraction/shortening event), which means you cannot tetanize cardiac muscle. There is a very sharp phase 0, phase 1 isn't strong, phase 2 is very droopy and hybrid with phase 3, then return to resting (4). The shape looks different than the idealized shape. It is expected because it is different in several parts of the heart. This depends on what channels are in the membranes of the heart. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atrial tissue is droopy phase 2, and merged w/ 3.</li>
<li>purkinje fibers show a less droppy phase 2</li>
<li>Endocardial shows similar to above</li>
<li>Midmyocardias shows a large plateau that is flat for phase 2</li>
<li>Epicardial, has a rather short plateau, and a faster fall.</li>
<li><em>Sino atrial (SA nodal), and atrial ventricular (AV nodal) regions you see the slow slow pacemaker action potential shapes.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Video 2(B) - Genesis of the Cardiac Fast Action Potential.</h4>
<p>Factors that affect the appearance of the fast cardiac action potential. There is a higher [Na+]0 &gt; [Na+]i, unlike K, where [K+]0 &lt; [K+]i, and [Ca2+]0 &lt; [Ca2+]i. It is these concentrations (which are used for the E_Nernst) that determine the shape of the fast cardiac action potential.</p>

<ul>
<li>Phase 0 - (rapid upstroke from negative resting potential to somewhat positive value)
<ul>
<li>Sodium inrush current, [Na+]_o is high        and interior of the cell is negative w.r.t the outside.</li>
<li>both the chemical and electrostatic forces both favor the entry of Na+ into the cell through fast Na+ channels to generate the upstroke.</li>
<li>negative interior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 1 - (Initial repolarization)
<ul>
<li>Depends on potassium efflux. There is a fast (i_to) transient outward K+ current, which accounts for this early phase. How prominent this is depends on the density of the channels that conduct i_to in the particular caridac cell.</li>
<li>chemical and electrical forces both favor the efflux of K+ through i_to channels to generate early, partial repolarization.</li>
<li>positive interior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 2 - (plateau phase)
<ul>
<li>Balance between inflow of Ca2+ down its concentration gradient and an efflux of K+. The voltage is a bit positive or a bit negative, so electrical drive is not very strong, but chemical (concentration) will determine.</li>
<li>Depending on conductivity of various Ca and K channels, it will determine if it droops a bit and how long it will last.</li>
<li>During the plateau, the net influx of Ca++ through Ca++ channels is balanced by the efflux of K+ through i_K, i_K1, and i_to channels.</li>
<li>positive interior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 3 - (recovery/repolarization period)
<ul>
<li>Calcium channels have closed, so primarily determined by which of the several K channels permit efflux.</li>
<li>The chemical forces that favor the efflux of K+ through i_k and i_k1 channels predominate over the electrostatic forces that favor the influx of K+ through these same channels.</li>
<li>chemical out, electrical in for K</li>
<li>negative interior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 4 - (resting potential)
<ul>
<li>slight K+ efflux during baseline.</li>
<li>The chemical forces that favor the efflux of K+ thorugh I_k, i_k1 channels very slightly exceed the electrostatic forces that favor the influx of K+ through these same channels.</li>

<h4>Video 3(C) - Genesis of the Cardiac fast Action Potential, (continued.</h4>
<p>There is more than one kind of Ca2+ channels and several K+ channels. The Ca2+ channels are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>L-type Ca2+ Channel</strong> - long-lasting channel. many more of these kinds of channels comapared to t-type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Effects of isoproterenol (an agonist), the open channel is potentiated (~2x).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T-type Ca2+ Channel</strong> - transient (opens and closes quickly). not very many, compared to L-type</p>
<ul>
<li>With Isoproterenol (an agonist), it slightly increases the negative value of the current conducted, and extends its slow recovery to normal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Calcium that comes in from cardiac action plateau phase helps determine the shape, but is some of the calcium that contributes to contraction.</p>
<p>Diltiazem is a drug that is an <em>antagonist</em> for Ca2++ channels, the action potential peaks and isometric contractile forces decrease. there is a bigger droop in phase 2 of the fast action potential (because it is a balance of efflux of K+ and an influx of Ca2+ -- and if Ca2+ influx is reduced then the eflux of K+ will begin to dominate and you will get a more dominant repolarization). recovery starts sooner in time because Na+ dominates, so a shorter duration of the action potentital.</p>
<p>For Potassium it is more complicated because there are more different kinds of current:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>i_t0,1</strong> - outward transient (faster)</li>
<li><strong>i_t0,2</strong> - outward transient (slower)
<ul>
<li>both this and i_t0,1 contribute to phase 1, the innitial recovery behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>i_k1</strong>, exists during phase 3, and during phase 4, but not during phases 1 or 2.
<ul>
<li>inwardly rectified current.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>i_kr</strong> - rapid, activates early, during phase 1, and has its effects during the early plateau and early recovery phase.
<ul>
<li>delayed rectifier current</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>i_ks</strong> - slower, activates more slowly and has its effects later into the plateau and into recovery phase (3)
<ul>
<li>delayed rectifier current, delayed into phase 2/3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inwardly Rectifying K+ currents (i_K1)</strong> - positive values are outward currents, negative values represent inward currrents. the V_m coordinate (aka E_k = 0), is the reversal potential. the slope of this curve in conductance. In the region of the plateau (around V_m = ~0mV there is no conductivity) so i_K1 is not going to be contributing. as you get further into the droop of the plateau/recovery there will be effect (outward potassium current).</p>
<h4>Video 4(D) - Genesis of the Cardiac Slow Action Potential <em>(Pacemaker)</em></h4>
<p>The pacemaker has a phase 4, 0, and 3. During Phase 4 which in cardiac fast action potentials is resting current, during the slow action potential it is a slow increase, which then triggers during phase 0 and recovers during phase 3.</p>
<p>The contributing trans-membrane potential charges that occur are:</p>
<ol>
<li>An inward Ca2+ current: <strong>i_Ca</strong></li>
<li>A hyperpolarization induced inward current: <strong>i_f,Na</strong> (note, these are called &quot;funny&quot; type currents)</li>
<li>an outward k+ curent: <strong>i_K</strong></li>
</ol>

<tr><td>i_f,Na</td><td>inward, hyperpolarization induced</td><td>Phase 4 (sub threshold)</td></tr>
<tr><td>i_K</td><td>outward</td><td>Phase 3 (recovery)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The i_f,Na current beings the depolarization phase (Phase 4), and at the very end there is an inrush of i_Ca, which at its start gives the end of the depolarization, and the rise (phase 0). Recovery is by an outward Potassium current.</p>
<p>You can modulate heart rate by modulating the rate slope of phase 4, so that there is more time between beats. You can also increase the threshold potential or increase the magnitude of the maximum diastolic potential (make negative potential reached deeper). This means it takes longer for it to reach threshold. Both these can be combined.</p>
<h4>Video 5(E) - Electrical Activation of the Heart (8:00)</h4>
<p>Small background on heart anatomy. The heart is divided into left/right by the <strong>steptum</strong> (interatrial and interventricular) and top/bottom. Divided left/right at the bottom of the heart are the <strong>Ventricles</strong> which are the main pumping chambers of the heart. on the top are the <strong>Atriums</strong>. The left portion of the heart is the <em>right side of the heart</em>*. AN easy way to remember this is to view it from your point of view facing out.</p>
<p>Pathway of blood:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Superior vena cava - brings blood to heart from upper part of body (arms chest head)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inferior vena cava - brings blood to heart from lower parts of body (legs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventricles</p>
<ul>
<li>These deposit blood into the right atrium. Near here there is a specialized cells that fire the pacemaker action potential <strong>Sinoatrial node</strong>.</li>
<li>Because the cells are in a synsnctium (?) they conduct to the left atrium, and bring the action potential to the <strong>atrio ventricular node</strong>, in the bottom center of the right atrium, near the septum. The node has conducting cells called the <strong>bundle of His</strong>, and it splits bundles down the lower ventricles inside the ventricles for the left and right branch through what is called <strong>Purkinje fibers</strong>.</li>
<li>There is a delay through the AV node before it reaches the Bundle of His, so that the atria can contract, before the ventricles contract. The ventricles contract from the bottom up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delay of nodes</strong> - Conduction delay between AV node, and bundles on AV septum. Delay through the AV node of 90mS, and delay thorough the structural wall 40ms. total delay from arrival of action potential at the AV node (atria have been activated) and arrival at the bundle branch is about 130ms, gives times for atria to contract and empty blood into respective ventricles.</p>
<p>Main pacemaker in the heart is the SA node, the AV node will pick up if the SA node doesn't work. will work rhymthically but at a slower rate. The purkinje fibers can also fire rhytmically if there is a problem of conudction between AV and purkinje (more of a clinical issue).</p>
<h4>Video 6(F) - Genesis of EKG (8:48)</h4>
<p>Whole organ mechanism based on the whole heart. Looking at it from electrodes on the surface on the skin, making it more of a whole body. Electro Cardio Gram (EKG). two dimensional representation of the heart.</p>
<p>Charge distributions set up and electrical fields set up in the.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ventricular septum is depolarized not the whole heart, so the mass of the ventricle is contributing to the EKG. There is an electrical vector with an orientation and amplitude in space, which on the two dimensional plane of the chest is top to bottom, left to right. (EKG's will take a 12 lead EKG which gives a projection of the leads on the side of the heart to get better vectors on a side to side.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The simplest EKG is using three leads, one on each wrist, and one on the right (personal left) ankle. With measurements being:</p>
<ul>
<li>left wrist : -0.2mV
<ul>
<li><strong>LEAD 1:</strong> between wrists is +0.5mV</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>right wrist : +0.3mV
<ul>
<li><strong>LEAD 2:</strong> between right wrist and ankle is +0.7mV</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>right ankle : +1.0 mV
<ul>
<li><strong>LEAD 3:</strong> between left wrist and ankle is +1.2mV</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The electrical vector of the ventricle, which at that time is pointing towards the left ventricle. This is because the left ventricular wall is thicker than the right so there is more tissue mass, favoring the left.</p>

<ul>
<li>P-wave is depolarization of the atria</li>
<li>Contraction of atria is P-R</li>
<li>QRS complex is ventricular depolarization, with higher amplitude due to difference in mass</li>
<li>T wave is ventricular depolarization</li>
<li>Atrial depolarization is swamped in QRS complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intervals are diagnostic:</p>
<ul>
<li>PR - atrial contraction issues</li>
<li>QRS - ventricular contraction issues</li>
<li>ST - elevation is myocardial infarction</li>
<li>QT - long is indicative of electrical problem</li>
</ul>
<p>For devices, have issues w/ signal to noise. measure amplitudes, bandwith because of speed of measurings. with digital systems, what is sampling rate to measure frequency content. (do a Fourier, for 90% of energy to get the sampling rate).</p>
